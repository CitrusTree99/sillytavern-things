# Citrus' SillyTavern Stash
Collection of Citrus' random SillyTavern stuff.

## Current SillyTavern Setup
**SillyTavern:** Latest Staging
**Usual Models:** GLM 4.7 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 + rarely Opus 4.5
**Preset:** Screwdriver (Available in this repo)
**Theme:** Inkwell (Available in this repo)
My currently active **Extensions** as of 08/01/2026 are:
* [Chat Top Info Bar](https://github.com/SillyTavern/Extension-TopInfoBar)
* [CSS Snippets](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-CssSnippets)
* [Extension Manager](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-ExtensionManager)
* [RPG Companion](https://github.com/SpicyMarinara/rpg-companion-sillytavern)
* [World Info Locks](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/SillyTavern-WorldInfoLocks)
* [WorldInfo Info](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WorldInfoInfo)
* Connection Profiles (Core Extension)
* Regex (Core Extension)
* Token Counter (Core Extension)

I may use other extensions for specific cases but these up there are pretty much always enabled no matter what. RPG Companion isn't *always* enabled in all my chats but it's an essential requirement for my more RPG-styled narrator cards and as such I still keep the extension enabled and just disable it on its settings.
