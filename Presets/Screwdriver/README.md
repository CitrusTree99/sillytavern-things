# Screwdriver
Because sometimes you just need a screwdriver.

This is a rather simple-but-complex preset built on Marinara's Universal Preset 9.0 and expanded upon. It follows the same methodology of using variables to generate a central "primary" prompt with all required information but also adds new features such as toggleable genres and "modules" that extend functionality a little more.

Basically you choose a Role, Tense, Narration, POV, Length, Content Guidelines and OPTIONAL Genres and Modules. There's a variety of options but I made sure not to add things I personally did not find necessary. And even the things that aren't truly necessary but I still thought were worth it are optional and stashed away from the more necessary prompts on the drawer.

Other than some prompts being rewritten and modifying the formatting of the preset drawer to my own personal standard and such this is still basically an expansion of Marinara's work. As such, most credit goes to her.
